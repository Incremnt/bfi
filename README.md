## Building from source
To build the interpreter, you need **Flat Assembler (FASM)**.

1.  **Install FASM**:
    *   On Arch Linux and derivatives, install from the official repos:
        ```bash
        sudo pacman -S fasm
        ```
    *   For other distributions, download the Linux version from the [official FASM website](https://flatassembler.net/).

2.  **Build the repository**
   ```bash
        sudo make all
   ```

## Usage
To interpret the code from the input file, you need to execute interpreter with the input file.
1.  **Normal mode**:
   ```bash
    
        ./bfi input.bf
    
   ```
3.  **Embedded mode**:
    ```bash
    
        ./bfi --embed input.bf out.a
    
    ```
